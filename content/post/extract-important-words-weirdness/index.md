Learn how to identify and extract rare or meaningful words from a corpus by leveraging the concept of "weirdness." This approach enriches language processing applications, enabling you to highlight unique vocabulary and gain new linguistic insights.

## What Is Word Weirdness?

"Weirdness" measures how unusual or infrequently a word appears in a specific context compared to a general corpus. Words with high weirdness scores often reflect domain-specific jargon, neologisms, or outliers‚Äîuseful for tasks such as keyword extraction, content filtering, and building rich glossaries.

## The Extract-important-words-using-weirdness Project

The [Extract-important-words-using-weirdness](https://github.com/andersonmorillo/Extract-important-words-using-weirdness) tool, available on GitHub, helps you automate the process of extracting these unusual words from your own datasets. Although the README is currently limited, similar tools identify key features in text, often using statistical comparisons between domain and reference corpora.

Common pipeline steps include:

- Collecting text data (your domain corpus)
- Comparing term frequencies with those in a general corpus
- Scoring words using weirdness (e.g., by dividing relative frequency in the domain by that in the reference)
- Extracting and exporting the words with the highest scores

## Why Use Weirdness?

Extracting uncommon words is valuable when you want to:

- Build specialized dictionaries or lexicons
- Identify emerging trends or concepts
- Enhance search engines or NLP models with domain-specific awareness
- Support linguistic exploration

### Example Usage

Here is a practical example (conceptual pseudocode):

```python
from weirdness_extractor import extract_weird_words

domain_corpus = load_corpus('my_domain_text.txt')
general_corpus = load_corpus('general_language_corpus.txt')

# Extract top 50 unusual words
weird_words = extract_weird_words(domain_corpus, general_corpus, top_n=50)
print(weird_words)
```
