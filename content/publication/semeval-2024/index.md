abstract: >
  This paper presents an artificial intelligence model designed to detect semantic relationships in natural language, addressing the challenges of SemEval 2024 Task 1. Our goal is to advance machine understanding of the subtleties of human language through semantic analysis. Using a novel combination of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, and an attention mechanism, our model is trained on the STR-2022 dataset. This approach enhances its ability to detect semantic nuances in different texts. The model achieved an 81.92% effectiveness rate and ranked 24th in SemEval 2024 Task 1. These results demonstrate its robustness and adaptability in detecting semantic relationships and validate its performance in diverse linguistic contexts. Our work contributes to natural language processing by providing insights into semantic textual relatedness. It sets a benchmark for future research and promises to inspire innovations that could transform digital language processing and interaction.

summary: >
  A multilayer AI model combining CNNs, LSTMs, and attention mechanisms to detect semantic relationships in natural language, evaluated in SemEval 2024 Task 1.
