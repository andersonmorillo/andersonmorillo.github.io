abstract: >
  Persuasive messages are increasingly prevalent on social networks, raising concerns across various communities. This study focuses on detecting news genre categories, framing, and persuasion techniques using lexical features. The proposed strategy leverages lexical weirdness to classify news articles as opinion pieces, factual reports, or satire. The approach was applied to subtasks 1 and 2 of SemEval 2023 Task 3.

summary: >
  This paper presents a lexical feature-based approach to identify news genres and persuasive framing in online content, utilizing lexical weirdness for classification.
